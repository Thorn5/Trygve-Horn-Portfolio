        "EastLondon": "I was born in East London, South Africa, in ‘76. The area was nature-on-steroids, teeming with wild animals, jungle-like plantlife, and warm rivers and oceans. It was an amazing place in which to be a child.",
        "CapeTown": "In high school I moved to Cape Town - Still beautiful, but not quite as wild. With Table Mountain, more nightlife, amazing food and its tourist culture, Cape Town was a great place in which to be a young adult. ",
        "BucketList": "Life in South Africa gave me the opportunity to experience and be a part of some pretty amazing things, many of which seemed mundane at the time:",
        "BucketList_Item_1": "I have climbed cliffs and jumped off waterfalls",
        "BucketList_Item_2": "I have held a black mamba snake",
        "BucketList_Item_3": "I lived through the end of Apartheid…",
        "Germany": "In 2010, my wife and I moved to Germany. Germany is a beautiful country, though the nature is tamer, quieter. I miss the wildness of South Africa, but there is a lot to appreciate about Germany. Germany is so much safer than South Africa, and after many years of living in Germany I finally feel safe in my home. Germany has a far more sophisticated, if broken, public transport system. And in Germany, if you need medical care, you will get it. ",
        "Work": "I taught English for several years, and now I’m ready to go back into development. I completed a full-stack coding bootcamp and I look forward to developing apps and websites, and learning new skills along the way. "
